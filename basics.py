# Variables do not need to be declared in Python like they do in JavasScript.
# Simply start with the name.

my_name = "Sah"

# Instead of console.log(), use print()
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + "!")

# Like JS, in Python strings can use either single or double quotes
print("sah")
print('sah')

# Variables can be re-declared like JS
# We've defined the variable "meal" here to the name of the food we ate for breakfast!
meal = "An english muffin"

# Printing out breakfast
print("Breakfast:")
print(meal)

# Now update meal to be lunch!
meal = 'Turkey sandwich'

# Printing out lunch
print("Lunch:")
print(meal)

# Now update "meal" to be dinner
meal = "Spaghetti with meatballs"
# Printing out dinner
print("Dinner:")
print(meal)
